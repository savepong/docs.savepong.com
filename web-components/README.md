# Web Components

### What are web components?

Web components are a set of web platform APIs that allow you to create new custom, reusable, encapsulated HTML tags to use in web pages and web apps. Custom components and widgets build on the Web Component standards, will work across modern browsers, and can be used with any JavaScript library or framework that works with HTML.

Web components are based on existing web standards. Features to support web components are currently being added to the HTML and DOM specs, letting web developers easily extend HTML with new elements with encapsulated styling and custom behavior.

### Libraries for building web components

Many libraries already exist that make it easier to build web components. [The libraries section](https://www.webcomponents.org/libraries) of the site has additional details but here are some you can try out:

* [Hybrids](https://github.com/hybridsjs/hybrids) is a UI library for creating Web Components with simple and functional API.
* [LitElement](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-element) uses [lit-html](https://github.com/Polymer/lit-html) to render into the element's Shadow DOM and adds API to help manage element properties and attributes.
* [Polymer](https://www.polymer-project.org/) provides a set of features for creating custom elements.
* [Slim.js](http://slimjs.com/) is an opensource lightweight web component library that provides data-binding and extended capabilities for components, using es6 native class inheritance.
* [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) is an opensource compiler that generates standards-compliant web components.
